      <h2 class="about">About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Trevor. For as long as I can remember, I have been
        invested in the technology of our time and what is to come. I've been
        playing video games since the moment my hands were big enough to use a
        controller. That's exactly when my passion started. From a young age, I
        was fascinated with what computers were capable of. What captivated me
        more so was how video games took my actions and translated them into the
        virtual worlds before me. Outside of that, I have many other passions;
        Such as music, movies, books, and even space travel. There are many more
        things to know about me, and here I'll mention some more of my
        background, skills, what I want to do, and what I like to do for fun.
      </p>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <img class="google" src="img/Google-IT.jpg" alt="A picture of the Google IT Program"/>
      <p class="background">
        Before enrolling in <em>Epicodus</em>, I briefly attended college. When
        I discovered that it wasn't really for me, I moved on. From there I
        began working on an
        <span class="highlight">IT Support Specialist Certification</span>.
        However, before I finished, I ended up getting a Job as
        <span class="highlight">Web Developer and Software Instructor</span>.
        This helped boost my knowledge but also kickstarted my tech career. I
        ultimately enrolled in a coding bootcamp to start taking real steps
        towards my dream career in
        <span class="highlight">Game Development</span>.
      </p>

      <h3>Hobbies, Interests, etc.</h3>
      <p class="larger"><u>
        Here I will list 5 hobbies, interests, skills, and so on.
      </p>
      </u>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I play a lot of video games. I grew up playing consoles such as the
          N64 and the Gamecube. I did every thing I could to get my hands on as
          many different consoles as I could. Then eventually building my first
          PC. Gaming is my favorite thing to do. There are so many magical
          aspects to games that never cease to amaze me.
        </li>
        <li>
          I also play tons of <strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong>. I started
          playing about half way through high school. We would all get together
          after school and play until we couldn't keep our eyes open. DnD is an
          way to bond with people, as it builds comradery amongst friends, and
          provides a fantastic creative outlet for the players.
        </li>
        <li>
          I enjoy singing/playing instruments. I grew up in a musical household,
          where I started playing the drums as early as 2 years old. Through the
          years I took part in as many of my school's music programs as
          possible. Eventually I joined the choir. Ever since, playing music has
          brought me immense joy.
        </li>
        <li>
          I would like to move all over the world. There are far too many things
          on our beatiful planet that I would like to see, and simply not enough
          time to see it all. That's why I would like to try see as much as a I
          can by moving to various places around the world, and get to
          experience different cultures.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm pretty good at picking up new things. Anytime I am learning
          something new I've become fairly good at picking up and understanding
          concepts quickly. Especially with things that I'm interested in.
