    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      There are many things to know about me, here I'll mention some of my
      background, skills, what I want to do, and what I like to do for fun.
    </p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      Before enrolling in Epicodus, I briefly attended college. When I
      discovered that it wasn't really for me, I moved on. From there I began
      working on an IT Support Specialist Certification. However, before I
      finished, I ended up getting a Job as Web Developer and Software
      Instructor. This helped boost my knowledge but also kickstarted my tech
      career. I ultimately enrolled in a coding bootcamp to start taking real
      steps towards my dream career in Game Development.
